# What is it?
This is a special program designed for automated receipt and processing of logs from the KEENETIC router

### Is there an adaptation of this program for other routers?
No. I requested that keenetic routers be used specifically because they are very convenient

### Is there documentation for the project?
Yes, she is [HERE](https://github.com/YakovSava/time_recorder/blob/master/docs/README.md). However, in addition to the functions used, there may also be unused ones in the main executable file (*main.py*)
